## QA Operating Mode

This repository runs with a QA-first gate model:

- QA governance docs: `docs/qa/`
- Gate runner script: `Scripts/qa/Invoke-QAGate.ps1`
- Playwright gate commands: `webapp/package.json` (`qa:baseline`, `qa:full`, `qa:pr`, `qa:premerge`, `qa:prerelease`)
- Button contract coverage tests: `webapp/tests/e2e/button-contract.spec.ts`

Run baseline gate locally:

```powershell
.\Scripts\qa\Invoke-QAGate.ps1 -Gate baseline
```
